🎯Project Spotlight: Sentiment Analysis Application
📋Project Overview->

The Sentiment Analysis Application classifies user-entered reviews as either positive or negative. Built with Streamlit for an interactive experience, this application uses pre-trained machine learning models to predict sentiment and includes multiple evaluation metrics to assess model performance in real-time.

🛠️Tools Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:

Pandas & NumPy: For efficient data handling and preprocessing
Scikit-learn: For model training, testing, and performance evaluation
NLTK: Text cleaning and stemming for natural language processing
Streamlit: Developing an intuitive user interface

🔍Key Steps->

Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
Text Cleaning: Removed special characters, converted text to lowercase, and applied stemming.
Stopword Removal: Filtered out common stopwords to retain essential words.
CountVectorizer: Converted cleaned text into numerical data for training and predictions.
Model Selection & Training
Trained various classifiers to identify the most accurate model for sentiment analysis:
Decision Tree
K-Nearest Neighbors
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
AdaBoost
Gradient Boosting
Support Vector Classifier
Saved models as .pkl files for easy integration and selection.
Model Evaluation & Metrics
Used several metrics to evaluate model performance:
Accuracy: Measures overall prediction correctness.
Bias & Variance: Training and test accuracies to assess generalizability.
Confusion Matrix: Visualizes true and false positive/negative rates.
Classification Report: Includes Precision, Recall, and F1-score for each class.
Frontend with Streamlit
Interactive Elements: Users can enter a review and select a classifier for real-time predictions.
Model Comparison: Displays accuracy and bias-variance analysis, helping users understand model strengths.
Visualizations: Confusion matrix and classification report give insights into model performance.

📊Key Findings->

Best Performing Model: Logistic Regression achieved reliable accuracy, balancing efficiency and simplicity.
Additional Insights: Decision Tree and Random Forest performed well but tended to overfit training data.

🌐Applications->

The Sentiment Analysis App is versatile and can be applied in multiple contexts:

Customer Review Analysis: Helps businesses gauge sentiment in customer feedback.
Social Media Monitoring: Assists social media managers in tracking sentiment trends.
Market Research: Aids in assessing public opinion on products or events.

🔮Future Improvements->

Advanced Preprocessing: Adding techniques like TfidfVectorizer for improved feature extraction.
Expanded Sentiment Classes: Including neutral sentiment for more nuanced classification.
Visualization Over Time: Enabling insights into evolving sentiment trends.
